Using find_GB.py, input your particle coordinates in a time series: x, y, frame.
The output of each function is saved as all are useful for other purposes.

Firstly, find the bond-orientational order parameter Psi6.
  This has a nearest neighbour cut-off to help with particles at the edge and adjacent to vacancies/impurities.
  This is smoothed over two shells of nearest neighbours to reduce noise in GB finding.
  Returns x; y; frame; modulus of psi6 (i.e. crystallinity); argument of psi6 (i.e. orientation).
  
Next, find the grains using a cluster algorithm.
  Goes particle by particle, checks if crystalline (|psi6| > 0.7), has 3 neighbours of close orientation.
  Gives lists of particles and neighbours that are part of the same grain, overlapping lists are joined to create a list of the paritcles in a grain.
  Returns same as Psi6, with extra column in which each particle is labelled with their grain number.
  N.B. Each grain number is regnerated per frame, so no correlation across frames (you can track centre-of-masses with Crocker and Grier although not perfect).

Finally, find the grain boundary segments.
  A grain boundary segment is found by doing a Delaunay triangulation of all the particles and finding the connections between particles in different grains.
  These form triangles A0->B->A1, of particles in grains A and B, where A0 and A1 are neighbours in the same grain.
  Segment is the joined midpoints of A0->B and B->A1.
  Returns the coordiantes of midpoints A0->B and B->A1, as well as the IDs of grains A and B.
  Also returns distance of segment from grains A and B. Useful for deleting spurious GBs that aren't really GBs due to frustrated crystallisation etc.
  Finally returns misorientation and length of this segment.
